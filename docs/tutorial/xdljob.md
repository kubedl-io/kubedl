# Run a XDLJob with KubeDL Operator

This tutorial walks you through an example to run a XDLJob. [XDL](https://github.com/alibaba/x-deeplearning) is an open sourced deep learning engine from Alibab

## Requirements

Before starting this tutorial, you should [install KubeDL Operator](https://github.com/alibaba/kubedl#getting-started) and [enable XDLJob workload](https://github.com/alibaba/kubedl#optional-enable-workload-kind-selectively).

## Install ZooKeeper

XDLJob depends on ZooKeeper to make its pods communicate with each other.

Below installs a single  instance of ZooKeeper.

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alibaba/kubedl/master/docs/tutorial/v1/xdl-zk.yaml
```

For production environment, you can follow the [offical tutorial](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/stateful-application/zookeeper/) to install a three-node ZooKeeper ensemble.

## Run a XDLJob

We need to set `ZooKeeper server address` and `ConfigMap` accordingly in the [XDL Job yaml](v1/xdl-job.yaml).
For every container in XDLJob, KubeDL operator will substitute the environment variables ```TASK_NAME``` and ```TASK_INDEX``` to identify every pod.
Also, KubeDL operator will modify the `ZK_ADDR` env to add job UUID.

Below runs a XDL job.

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alibaba/kubedl/master/docs/tutorial/v1/xdl-job.yaml
```

## Verify XDL Job Started

Check the XDLJob is started, and all pods are Running.

```bash
kubectl get xdljob

NAME                STATE     AGE   TTL-AFTER-FINISHED   MAX-LIFETIME
xdl-mnist-example   Running   70s   3600

kubectl get po

xdl-mnist-example-worker-1      1/1     Running   0          116s
zk-c5cc46c8d-s6bkc              1/1     Running   0          2m26s
```
